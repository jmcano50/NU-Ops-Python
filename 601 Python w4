""" This Python program calculates how much an employee should be paid based 
on the number of hours they worked and their hourly rate. If they worked more than 
40 hours, the program adds overtime pay at 1.5 times the regular hourly rate 
for any extra hours. The program prompts the user to enter the hours worked and the 
hourly rate, it uses float() to convert the input into numbers, and then calculates 
the gross pay, including overtime. Finally, it prints the total gross pay."""

# Prompt user for hours and rate
hours = float(input("Enter hours worked: "))
rate_per_hour = float(input("Enter rate per hour: "))

# Overtime Conditions
if hours > 40:
    overtime_hours = hours - 40
    gross_pay = (40 * rate_per_hour) + (overtime_hours * rate_per_hour * 1.5)
else:
    gross_pay = hours * rate_per_hour

# Print result
print("Gross Pay:", gross_pay)
