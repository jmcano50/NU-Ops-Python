# Prompt the user for hours worked
hours = input("Enter Hours: ")
# Convert the input to a float
hours = float(hours)

# Prompt the user for the rate per hour
rate = input("Enter Rate per Hour: ")
# Convert the input to a float
rate = float(rate)

# Calculate gross pay
gross_pay = hours * rate

# Print the result
print("Gross Pay:", gross_pay)
